# Covid-19 Xray Classifier Using Neural Network

I did this project as an assignment for AI course at University of Tehran. in this project a feed forward neural network was designed to classify x-ray images of patients to tell if they have Covid/Pneuma or they are healthy. The model is created using Tensorflow with Keras library.

To experiment with different parameters and approaches, these things were also tried:

* Different activation functions with normalized and non-normalized data
* Momentum
* Adam optimizer
* Effects of epochs
* Using MSE on classification problems
* Regularization with L2 and Dropout
